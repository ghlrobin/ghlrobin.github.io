## Learn about Markdown

### What is Markdown?

According to the creator himself, John Gruber,

> Markup is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).

His philosophy is to emphasize two things: readability and "write-ability".

Below is me (nearly completely) paraphrasing the syntax guide in the creator's [website](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).

### Headers

To set headers you can do this (Setext-style):

	This is H1
	==========

	This is H2
	----------

But I prefer (atx-style):
	
	# This is H1
	## This is H2 ##
	### This is H3
	#### This is H4
	##### This is H5

You can "close" atx-style headers but this is purely cosmetic. (The closing hashes don't even  need to mach the number of hashes used to open the header!)

### Blockquotes

Markdown uses email-style `>` characters for blockquoting. Apparently it looks best if you put a `>` before every line:

> so this is what it looks like

Blockquotes can be nested by adding additional <mark>></mark>:

> First level of quoting
> > second level
> > > and the third

And they can contain other Markdown elements, including headers, lists, and code blocks:

> #### This is a header.
> 
> 1.   This is the first list item.
> 2.   This is the second list item.
> 
> Here's some example code:
> 
>     return shell_exec("echo $input | $markdown_script");
	
### Lists

Markdown supports ordered (1. 2. 3.) and unordered lists (*, + or -).

	* First
	* Second
	+ Third
	- Fourth

And ordered lists use numbers followed by periods:

	1. Robin
	2. Mayya
	3. Kisa

Note that the actual numbers you use have no effect on the HTML output Markdown produces.

You can also do weird things:

*   A list item with a blockquote:

    > This is a blockquote
    > inside a list item.

*   A list item with a code block:

        <code goes here> (you need to indent twice!)

### Code Blocks

The lines of a code block are interpreted literally. Markdown wraps a code block in both `<pre>` and `<code>`. Just indent once and you are good to go.

	here is a line of code. Just note that you need a blank line above. You don't need a blank line below but it probably looks nice while you work to have one.

### Horizontal Rules

You can produce horizontal rule tag (`<hr />`) by placing three or more hyphens, asterisks, or underscores on a line by themselves.

	* * *
	***
	*****
	- - -
	---------------

### Links

Markdown supports two style of links: *inline* and *reference*. In both styles, the link text is delimited by [square brackets].

Typing this:

	This is [an example](http://example.com/ "Title") of an inline link

	[This link](http://example.com/) has no attribute.

will result in:

***
This is [an example](http://example.com/ "Title") of an inline link.

[This link](http://example.com/) has no attribute.
***

If you are referring to a local resource on the same server, you can use relative paths:

	See my [About](/about/) page for details.

Reference-style links use a second set of square brackets, inside with you place a label of your choosing to identify the link:

	This is [an example][id] of a reference-style link.

Then, anywhere in the document, you define your link label like this, on a line by itself:

	[id]: http://example.com/ "Optional Title Here"

### Emphasis

Markdown treats (`*`) and underscores(`_`) as indicators of emphasis. Text wrapped with one of the indicators will be wrapped with an HTML `<em>` tag, a double will be wrapped with an HTML `<strong>` tag.

	*single asterisks*
	_single underscore_
	**double asterisks**
	__double underscores__

### Code

To indicate a span of code, wrap it with backtick quotes (`` ` ``). Unlike a pre-formatted code block, a code span indicates code within a normal paragraph.

	Use the `print()` function

### Images

Markdown uses an image syntax that is intended to resemble the syntax for links, allowing for two styles: _inline_ and _reference_.

Inline image syntax looks like this:

	![Alt text](/path/to/img.jpg)

	![Alt text](/path/to/img.jpg "Optional Title")

That is:

* An exclamation mark: `!`
* followed by a set of square brackets, containing the `alt` attribute text for the image
* followed by a set of parentheses, containing the URL or path to the image, and an optional `title` attribute enclosed in double of single quotes.

Reference-style image syntax looks like this:

	![Alt text][id]
	
	[id]: url/to/image "Optional title attribute"

### Miscellaneous

#### Automatic links

Simply surround the URL or email address with angle brackets. <http://example.com/> and <address@example.com> was made by typing:

	<http://example.com/> and <address@example.com>

#### Backslash Escapes

Markdown allows you to use backslash escapes to generate literal characters which would otherwise have special meaning in Markdown's formatting syntax.

Markdown provides backslash escapes for the following characters:

	\   backslash
	`   backtick
	*   asterisk
	_   underscore
	{}  curly braces
	[]  square brackets
	()  parentheses
	#   hash mark
	+   plus sign
	-   minus sign (hyphen)
	.   dot
	!   exclamation mark

### Round Up

And that's it! Basically copying word for word the syntax guide really helped me better understand how to use Markdown to its fullest. I highly recommend anyone else who are getting into Markdown to do the same. Again, here's the link to the [syntax guide](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax). Just note that if you Markdown doesn't support certain elements you can just use the HTML notation. For example, Markdown doesn't support Highlight element so you can write `<mark>this is highlighted</mark>` to get <mark>this is highlighted</mark>.

## Pandas

I watched the lectures on Pandas. I've never used the library much so everything was pretty new to me. I think it's one of those things where you just have to start a project using the library to get a feel of it; there is a limit to how much you can learn just in a lecture, jotting down notes.

Here is the [link][pandas] to my notes.

[pandas]: https://github.com/ghlrobin/Boostcamp_AI_Tech_4/blob/94d00f49582df0796094c56520206294a8cebf73/lecture_notes/python_lecture_07_pandas.ipynb
	
## Miscellaneous

### Useful VS Code shortcuts I learned today

1. `Ctrl + Space` = Trigger Suggest. It pops down the suggestion thingy
2. `Ctrl + Shift + Space` = Trigger Parameter Suggest. When your cursor is in between the parenthesis of a function, it shows a simple documentation of the function.

### Python

1. `@` is a binary operation for matrix multiplication if it is in the middle of the line) and is a class or a function *decorator** if it is at the start.

## Things I Will Do

### Tomorrow
1. There is the team introductory presentation in the morning
2. Study the book, "Mathematics for Machine Learning" ([this is the book](https://mml-book.github.io/book/mml-book.pdf))
3. Watch the later lectures on Boostcourse
4. Exercise in the morning
5. Use the Time Timer clock.

### Down the Line
1. Start preparing for coding tests
2. Read some research papers
3. Regular Expression.

## Day in Review

It was a good second day into the program. I studied well and there is a lot to learn. I'll take them one by one. I'm slowly figuring out how to streamline my work-flow and my note-taking and publishing. I think it's a good idea to create separate Jupyter Notebooks for the lectures I watch. Not sure whether I'll just provide links here like I did today or rewrite it. We'll see.

The capture card I bought to connect my Canon M50 mark II to the computer just simply died on me. Firstly, it started to not recognize sound and then after a while it pushed out a very distorted fuzzy video footage as if it was some weird filter. Then finally, it would output just a black screen. Luckily, Coupang makes it easy to return faulty product (albeit rather too easily) so I requested a replacement.
