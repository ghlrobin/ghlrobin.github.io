# Day in Review

It was another decent day. We had an "Introduce your Team" Zoom meeting in the morning and I spent the entire afternoon installing VS Code extensions and setting it up. I've started to get the hang of Markdown and Github Pages as well. Then in the evening, we had our first mentor session. Our mentor was energetic and inspirational. He provided us with tons of priceless information and I got to better understand what I have to do (and there is a lot of it). The following five months will be an interesting joruney.
