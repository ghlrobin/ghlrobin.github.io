# Day in Review

## Deep Learning Basics Lectures

The lectures were uploaded to boostcourse at 9 am and I started watching them. They were fairly straight forward basic overview of different deep learning models like CNN, RNN, generative models and tranformers. It started off with a brief historical review and Multi Layer Perceptron and I just about finished watching the last lecture on Convolution Neural Network. There were 5 assignments but they were very basic follow-along-the-praticals-shown-in-the-lecture kind of assignments so they took little to no time. I did them first. I will of course have to review them, understand the code line by line so that I can later replicate them on my own.

# Summary

Today was the substitute holiday for Foundation Day of Korea. It was overall a good day. I was able to concentrate well and learn a lot. I especially enjoyed watching the lecture briefly reviewing 5 CNN architectures focusing on how they improved upon the preceding models. I've also started my journey of building good eating and sleeping habits which will hopefully help with my mood swings. Let's make this week, yet another great week!
