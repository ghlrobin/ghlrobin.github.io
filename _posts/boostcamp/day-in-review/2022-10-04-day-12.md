# Day in Review

It's up to me how to best use the resources around me and I have to act as such. Whether it be time provided for mentor session, the time I have to study and the time I have to rest. I guess a lot of it is to do with time. And it seems right now that I don't have enough of it. My To-Do list is getting full while I can only do so much. Again, I just need to keep my head down and do things one at a time.

Today, I was less productive than yesterday but it wasn't so bad. I had a mentor session where our mentor shared the tools he uses as a developer. Then I wasted some time (a fair bit) in gather.town where we eventually realised that it is slightly above our ability to make a good custom map.
