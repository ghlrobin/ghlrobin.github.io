# Going into the Lecture

- **Neural Networks** are function approximators that stack affine transformations followed by nonlinear transformations. (수학적인 정의)
  
# Linear Neural Networks

- 목표: n개의 데이터를 잘 설명하는 모델을 찾는 것
- 그래서 데이터와 모델의 차이를 줄이는 것이 중요
- 그래서 MSE를 사용한다
- Gradient Descent를 할 때 learning rate를 잘 정해줘야한다.

# Multi-layer Perceptron

- To use multi-dimensional input and output, we use vectors and matrices
- One way to interpret a matrix is to regard it as a mapping between two vector spaces.

# Activation Functions

- we add activation functions to act as non-linear tranformations.
